/**
 * The Speedy JS Animation Manager builds ArrayBuffer caches for every interesting piece of information for fast retrieval,
 *  cache locality, and avoiding re-computing values.
 * A single ArrayBuffer is used for everything - it is resized much like C++ std::vector, by allocating an excessive amount of space,
 *  doubling that space when it is overfull, copying over old data. This is because we want to optimize this as best I know how, given
 *  the interface. The goal here is to prove that WASM isn't that great.
 * 
 * Registering an animation simply stores the animation. No unpacking is done at this time.
 * Registering a model simply stores the model data. No unpacking is done at this time.
 * Associating a model and an animation pre-generates 60 frames per second worth of pre-computed values for the given model and the
 *  given animation. On failure (bones do not match), the cache space used is freed. A mapping from ((animation, model) -> firstFrameOffset)
 *  is made, so that later retrieval consists of finding the first frame, moving forward by the frame stride to find the desired stride, and
 *  returning a Float32Buffer view to that chunk of memory.
 * Getting animation data is simply grabbing from the buffer at the correct location.
 * 
 * Resting memory use: nextBufferPointer
